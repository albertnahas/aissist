# Document Aissist Plugin README

## Why

The aissist-plugin directory currently lacks a README.md file, making it difficult for users to:
- Understand what the plugin provides
- Install and configure the plugin for Claude Code
- Learn about available slash commands and skills
- Contribute to or extend the plugin

A well-documented README following Claude Code plugin best practices will improve discoverability and adoption.

## What Changes

- Add comprehensive README.md to `aissist-plugin/` directory
- Document plugin installation process (local and marketplace-based)
- Explain directory structure and organization
- Provide usage examples for all slash commands
- Include developer documentation for contributions
- Link to main aissist CLI documentation

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: environment-aware-plugin-integration
- **Affected code**: New file `aissist-plugin/README.md`
- **User-facing**: Improved onboarding experience for plugin users
- **Documentation**: Enhanced developer experience and contribution guidelines
